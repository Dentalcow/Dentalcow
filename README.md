- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dentalcow
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, game development, lighting design, audio gear and 3d design/rendering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Unity, QLC+, GrandMA3, Unreal Engine for virtual production, and IOT development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, stuff that I can learn from.
